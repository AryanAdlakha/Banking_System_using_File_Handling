# Banking_System_using_File_Handling
A program using C language on the topic File Handling, Structure and Union.
 <br />Approach:
 <br />Letâ€™s discuss the approach in detail, covering all the functions and their explanation in detail-

 <br />Create a Menu in the main function and create different functions for the Menu, which will be called using switch case statements. There are four different functions-
 <br />account()- This function is used to create a new account.
 <br />transfermoney()- This function is used to transfer money to the account
 <br />checkbalance()- This function is used to check the balance in the account.
 <br />login()- This function is used to login into the account.
 <br />First, create an account of our user by calling the account() function after the creation of an account, store all the data into a file using file handling functions.
 <br />Then the user is able to transfer the amount to other users, for that transfermoney() function is called, and for checking the current balance in the account call checkbalance() function.
 <br />Concepts of file handling will be used to store the data of the users, and then read all data from that particular file, store structures in a file because they are easy to write and read.
